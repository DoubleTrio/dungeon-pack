- Adjust level curve to fit base PMDO

Changelog:

This version overall makes Wishmaker Cave a more fair, enjoyable (but still extremely tough) experience by fixing overtuned parts and makes necessary resources more available more consistently. With more feedback, the dungeon is subject to change

Wishmaker Cave:
- All floors now have
- More Leppa berries and Apples are more guaranteed to spawn throughout the dungeon
  - To compensate, the Wish Crystal has been nerfed slightly across the board with the amount of items
- Wish Crystals will now guarantee certain items depending on the category. Ex: Food will always give at least one Apple, recruitment will always give 1 Apricorn
- Additional Wish Gems are guaranteed to appear at later floors
- Some enemies were a bit overtuned and had their movesets and levels slightly nerfed. This should make progressing the beginning floors a bit easier
- Crystal Drain will now heal with the following stacks:
  - Stack 1: 1/2 (from 1/3)
  - Stack 2: 3/4 (from 1/2)
  - Stack 3: 1/1
- The amount of damage taken from Liquid Ooze with the Drain Crystal has been slightly reduced
- The Wish Crystal room has been slightly changed up!
- Dungeon tileset has been changed to better suit the theme
- New visitors have been added in story mode and offer some tips!
- Fixed several typos
- Made Wish Crystal choices more clear
- Fixed a bug in replays not turning back on the lights
- A new floor has been added for reaching the end!
