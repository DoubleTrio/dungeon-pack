Changelog:

This version overall makes Wishmaker Cave a more fair, enjoyable (but extremely tough) experience by fixing overtuned parts and makes necessary resources more available

Wishmaker Cave:
- 4 items can be carried instead of 2 for story mode.
- More Leppa berries and Apples are more guaranteed to spawn throughout the dungeon
- More Wish Gems are guaranteed to appear at later floors
- Some enemies were a bit overtuned and had their movesets and levels slightly nerfed. This should make progressing the beginning floors easier
- Crystal Drain will now heal the following: 1/2, 3/4, 1/1 for the damage dealt
- The Wish Crystal room has been slightly changed up
- A new room has been added for completing the dungeon! Jirachi can be unlocked by collecting 3 Wish Gems
- Dungeon tileset has been changed to better suit the theme
- Fixed several typos
