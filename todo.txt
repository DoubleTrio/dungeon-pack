add a guranteed wish crystal at the end

This version overall makes Wishmaker Cave a more fair, enjoyable (but still extremely tough) experience by fixing overtuned parts and makes necessary resources more available more consistently

Wishmaker Cave:
- More Leppa berries and Apples are more guaranteed to spawn throughout the dungeon
  - To compensate, the Wish Crystal has been nerfed slightly across the board with the amount of items
- An additional Wish Gem is guaranteed to appear at later floors
- Some enemies were a bit overtuned and had their movesets and levels slightly nerfed. This should make progressing the beginning floors a bit easier
- Crystal Drain will now heal with the following stacks:
  - Stack 1: 1/2 (from 1/3)
  - Stack 2: 3/4 (from 1/2)
  - Stack 3: 1/1
- The amount of damage taken from Liquid Ooze with the Drain Crystal has been slightly reduced
- The Wish Crystal room has been slightly changed up
- A new floor has been added for reaching the end!
- Dungeon tileset has been changed to better suit the theme
- Some NPCs have been added to story mode
- Fixed several typos
- Made Wish Crystal choices more clear
