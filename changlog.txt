Changelog:

This version overall makes Wishmaker Cave a more fair, enjoyable (but still extremely tough) experience by fixing overtuned parts and makes necessary resources more available. The dungeon is still subject to change with more feedback

Wishmaker Cave:
- A NEW special floor has been added for reaching the end of the dungeon!
- New visitors have been added in story mode and offer some tips and information about the dungeon
- A new Pok√©mon has taken role as shopkeeper
- Wish Crystal has been slightly nerfed across the board with the amount of items
  - However, to compensate, Leppa berries and Apples are more guaranteed to spawn throughout the dungeon

- Enemies now fit PMDO's new level curve
- New enemy encounters added to Wishmaker

- Additional Wish Gems are guaranteed to appear at later floors
- Crystal Drain will now heal with the following stacks:
  - Stack 1: 1/2 (from 1/3)
